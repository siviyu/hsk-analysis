# HSK Analysis of Chinese text

Shiny app programmed in R that matches tokens from text input to Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi (HSK) Chinese Proficiency Exam vocabulary by levels.

To use:
1. Access the app at https://siviyu.shinyapps.io/hsk-analysis/
2. Enter in your Chinese text (Please note that currently only HSK vocabulary in simplified Chinese is matched.)
3. Click 'Analyze.'
4. View the frequency chart and explore the table of vocabulary words.

Improvements that are in progress:
1. Break up word tokens that are separated by jiebaR and do not match directly to HSK vocabulary. Many are phrases that can be broken up into functional words/characters.
2. Match traditional Chinese characters.
3. Add on matching for Test of Chinese as a Foreign Language (TOCFL) vocabulary.
4. Make bar chart interactive and indicate the number of words for each level.
5. Implement web scraping to extract text from a webpage.

Please contact me if you have any feedback and enjoy! :)
